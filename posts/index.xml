      <description>In the last few years we have been experiencing a rise in fascination and enthusiasm for the understanding and development of Intelligent Machines. This has been result of Human curiosity through a long process of scientific discoveries, trials and errors and cold winters in between.
The concept of artificial beings that can think, have been part of mankind’s literature since ancient times. However the first idea of building a machine that can reason, probably belongs to Ramon Lull(XII), who attempted to device a machine that used logical means to produce knowledge .</description>

      <description>“Consciousness is the number of feedback loops required to create a model of your position in space with relationship to other organisms and finally with relationship to time.”   -Michio Kaku
  We may think of our selves, as individuals with perdurable minds throughout our life, with add-ons that come in and out, but with a fundamental uniqueness to ourselves that never mutates.
I believe this is actually not the case.</description>

      <description>All the emotions, sensations and thoughts we experience second to second, are the manifestation of patterns that have been repeating and evolving since the beginning of Space and Time. Patterns that are explained through the scientific method in arbitrary named fields such as Physics, Biology, Neuroscience.
The simple patterns in the past, grew in complexity and scope and brought to life new characteristics and behaviours unknown to the universe before. The Beginning of space-time, subatomic particles forming atoms, clouds of matter forming stars, planets giving conditions for life.</description>
